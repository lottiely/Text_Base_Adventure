## Text Based Adventure

#Description
This game was supposed a text based adventure where it's just an 
over-glorified quiz game that will lead to different endings.

This is just a project I started working on after 2 AM when I decided I 
needed to do more Python practice if I wasn't going to sleep. Looking 
back at it, it's just a bunch of spaghetti code, and the structure is 
confusing since I don't implement best practices... I guess.

Still new to Python, but when I have motivation and time, I'll probably 
be refactoring this and with a plot in mind.
